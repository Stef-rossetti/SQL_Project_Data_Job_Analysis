Analyze the monthly demand for skills by counting the number of job postings for each skill in the first quarter (January to March), 
utilizing data from separate tables for each month. 
Ensure to include skills from all job postings across these months. 
The tables for the first quarter job postings were created in the 
Advanced Section - Practice Problem 6 [include timestamp of Youtube video].

ðŸ”Ž Hints:

-- Use UNION ALL to combine job postings from January, February, and March into a consolidated dataset.
Apply the EXTRACT function to obtain the year and month from job posting dates, 
even though the month will be implicitly known from the source table.
Group the combined results by skill to summarize the total postings for each skill across the first quarter.
Join with the skills dimension table to match skill IDs with skill names.

-- With subquery:
SELECT
    skills_dim.skills,
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM combined_job_postings.job_posted_date) AS year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM combined_job_postings.job_posted_date) AS month,
    COUNT(combined_job_postings.job_id) AS postings_count
FROM (
    SELECT *
    FROM january_jobs
    UNION ALL
    SELECT *

    UNION ALL
    SELECT *

) AS combined_job_postings
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON combined_job_postings.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
GROUP BY
    skills_dim.skills, year, month
